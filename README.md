My journey in Natural Language Processing

I have been using code to analyze large text corpuses, these notebooks reflect my progress and steps taken in my analysis.

You will find text similarity, tokening, Word2Vec modelling, and topic modelling. Each notebook has its own explanation and references.

All code was tested and run on Google Collab.

If you are taking the NLP journey, please explore the notebooks in order, which is specified by the number on the name.

The only thing missing is the source text files, which are not included because they belong to Grupo Expansion.
